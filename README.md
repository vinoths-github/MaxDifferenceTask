# MaxDifferenceTask
This small utility will compute the max difference between the elements in Array


You are given an array of integers and must compute the maximum
difference between any item and any lower indexed smaller item for all
the possible pairs, i.e., for a given array 'a', find the maximum value of a[j]
- a[i] for all i, j where 0 ≤ i < j < n and a[i] < a[j]. If no item has a smaller
item with a lower index, then return -1.
For example, given an array [1, 2, 6, 4], you would first compare 2 to the
elements to its left. 1 is smaller, so calculate the difference 2 - 1 = 1. 6 is
bigger than 2 and 1, so calculate the differences 4 and 5. 4 is only bigger
than 2 and 1, and the differences are 2 and 3. The largest difference was
6 - 1 = 5.
